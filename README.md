# ML

In this file, you can find codes showcasing the use of multiple Machine Learning algorithms. 
There are 2 types of codes: 
* simple codes that only use the algorithm itself and shows how it can be used (meaning basic coding, parameters setting, cross-validation)
* complex codes when the algorithms are used in a project setting with a goal and complete analysis. The analysis is composed of data exploration, data prep, feature scaling, transformation pipelines, modeling and modeling evaluation. 

Note: all the datasets used in the codes are available in the datasets folder.

Simple codes are the following:
* Linear Regression
*  Logistic Regression
* Ridge & Lasso
* Tree-based Methods
* KNN
* KNN & Random Forest
* ANN
* Feature Selection
* Feature Selection & PCA

Complex codes are designed with title ML Project:
* ML Project- Regression
* ML Project - Causal Inference (BaseSRegressor, Shapley Values, XGBTRegressor, BaseTRegressor)
